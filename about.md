# Pentester Lover
I'm a boy from Spain who is 17 years old and I’ve been study cybersecurity from when I have 10 years old. I started studying Pentesting hard when I was 14 years old. Today I’m focused on the branch of the Red-Team, actually studying a middle-grade of Microcomputer Systems and Networks. I started this project at the age of 16 years old(2022).
